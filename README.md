# ANALYSIS OF SUPERVISED LEARNING TECHNIQUES TO EVALUATE PULSAR CANDIDATES

A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation  out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (much like the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense, and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

HTRU2 is a data set which describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (South). Dataset characteristics is as follows:

This study is intended to label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis, by applying different Machine Learning techniques on set of attributes which were extracted from real-world pulsar observations.

The general conclusion for the experiment is as follows:
